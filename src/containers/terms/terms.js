You hereby affirm, represent, and warrant that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to publish Content you submit; and you license to eMUQ all intellectual property and proprietary rights in and to such Content for use pursuant to these Terms of Service.
By submitting Content to eMUQ you hereby grant to eMUQ the sole and exclusive right to the Content including, but not limited to, any and all copyrights, trademarks and related intellectual property rights arising out of or related thereto, whereby eMUQ shall have the sole and exclusive worldwide, transferable right to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the Content, in  whole or in part, in connection with the Service and eMUQ's (and its successors' and affiliates') business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels, whether now known or hereafter discovered, in perpetuity. The assignment of rights granted by you in the Content you submit to eMUQ are perpetual and irrevocable.
You further agree that Content you submit to the Service will not contain third party copyrighted material, or material that is subject to other third party proprietary rights, unless you have prior written permission from the rightful owner of the material or you are otherwise legally entitled to post the material and to grant eMUQ all of the license rights granted herein.
eMUQ does not permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of intellectual property rights on the Service, and eMUQ will remove all Content if properly notified that such Content infringes on another's intellectual property rights. eMUQ reserves the right to remove Content without prior notice.
